Converting Natural Language (English) to C code
There has been a lot of related work in the area of the use of natural language for the representation of code. This is done to the end of helping novice programmers and others who are unfamiliar with formal coding constructs. In this project, I aim at selecting a particular construct from the C language and writing a script in Scala to handle natural language (spoken English language) so as to obtain the C representation of it, and therefore compile and be able to run that code. The basic idea is to pick up code-style-logic from a simple English sentence. As per my discussion with you regarding this and my survey of existing work, it would be very difficult to implement even multiple number of constructs like this, let alone the whole language itself, so I am only going to select one construct to start with.
